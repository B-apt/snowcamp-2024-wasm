# Créer des plugins en Rust, TinyGo, ... 
## pour vos applications Go avec WebAssembly et Wazero et Extism
### SnowCamp 2024 ⛄️

---
# Agenda

- 🚧 work in progress

# 🍊 Gitpod

- 🚧 work in progress

# Wasm?

- Code > Bytecode (wasm binary file)
- Binary format for executing code on the Web
- The JavaScript VM is responsible for the execution of the WASM code
- WASM is polyglot
- WASM is safe

---

# Why WASM?

- A complement to JavaScript
- Near-native speeds
- Complex applications in web browsers

---

# WebAssembly in the browser is amazing

- https://earth.google.com/
- https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-5xrecy?file=index.js


---

# The primary qualities of WASM

- Speed, 
- Efficiency, 
- Safe, 
- Versatile, 
- Portable

---
# Free WASM from the browser

## Let it Go!

---

# Wasi?

> https://wasi.dev

- Wasi: WebAssembly System Interface
- Interface between 
  - WebAssembly (WASM) code  
  - and a Runtime environment
- Allowing WASM code to be run in various contexts (even the browser) 

---
# Some WASI Use Cases

- CLI applications
- Applications with plug-ins (Zellij, Lapce)
- Database UDF (ScyllaDB, PostgreSQL)
- WebHooks, Filters, … (Webhook Relay, Envoy)
- FaaS (Fermyon cloud, WasmCloud, Shopify, …)
- …
---
# At least, 3 ways to run Wasm programs outside the browser

- WASI Runtimes CLI
- WASI Runtimes SDK
- Ready to use applications with embedded Wasm runtime
  - Spin from Fermyon
  - Wasm Workers Server from Wasm Lab
  - …
---
# WASI Runtimes

- WasmEdge, 
- Wasmtime, 
- Wasmer, 
- Wazero 🩵, 
- NodeJS, 
- …

# Wasm/Wasi: some limitations

---
# 🚀 Exercise 05

- `05-call-functions-go.md`

---
# One of the “annoying” limitations

- Only numbers 😮
  - How to pass string arguments to a Wasm function?
  - How to return a string as the result of a Wasm function call?

---
# Solution

## Exchange data with the Shared Memory Buffer

# Wasi CLI: DIY 🛠️

- You can develop your own CLI
- But, you need to handle the limitations
  - == Develop all the **“plumbing”**

# Wazero Runtime & SDK 🩵🩵🩵

**wazero**: the **zero** dependency WebAssembly runtime for **Go** developers

> - https://wazero.io

---
# 🚀 Exercise 06

- Make your own CLI
- Call a function (not always simple)

---
# But, sometimes, you need more

- Make HTTP requests
- Make Redis requests from the Wasm module
- Use MQTT or NATS
- …

---
# Host Function?

- A function defined in the Host application
- For The Wasm program, it’s used as an import function

# “Helpers”, but…

- ✋ You need to write your own glue
- For every language you want to support on the Wasm side 😵‍💫

## 🤬 It’s complicated! But…

---
# There is another way (easier) 👀

### Give super powers to your Golang (but not only) applications

# Helpers and Ready to use host functions

```golang
pdk.Input()
mem := pdk.AllocateString("output")
pdk.OutputMemory(mem)
```

```golang
pdk.Log(pdk.LogInfo,,"")
req := pdk.NewHTTPRequest("GET", url)
pdk.OutputMemory(mem)
...
